Let's now discuss something related to "Heading Tags".<br>
HTML defines six levels of headings. 
A heading element implies all the font changes, 
paragraph breaks before and after, and any white space necessary to
 render the heading. The heading elements are H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6 
with H1 being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the least.<bbr>
<h1>Heading 1 is of the largest size</h1><br>
<h2>Heading 2 is the second most largest size</h2><br>
<h3>Heading 3 is the third most largest size</h3><br>
<h4>Heading 4 is the medium size in all heading tags</h4><br>
<h5>Heading 5 is the second smallest size</h5><br>
<h6>Heading is the smallest size</h6>
