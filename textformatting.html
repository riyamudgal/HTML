<body><p><center>Now, here we are taking about some more text formatting features in HTML.<br><br>
Let's go down one by one <br>
<br>
<br>

<b>1.</b>The HTML small element represents side-comments and small print, like copyright and legal text, 
independent of its styled presentation. By default, it renders text within it one font-size smaller, 
such as from small to x-small. Or simply we can say that, this tag is used to display very small text messages on web page.<br>
Example: This is some normal text.<br>
<small>This is some smaller text.</small><br><br>

<b>2.</b>The HTML mark tag is used to mark or highlight text that is of special interest or relevance in an HTML document. 
Browsers traditionally render the text found within the mark tag as text with a yellow background color. This tag is also 
commonly referred to as the mark element.<br>
Example: Let's focus on <mark>Studies</mark> today.<br><br>

<b>3.</b>The sub tag defines subscript text. Subscript text appears half a character below the normal line, and is
 sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Subscript text can be used for chemical formulas, like H2O. Tip: Use the sup tag to define superscripted text.<br>
Example:Some chemistry formulae H<sub>2</sub>S0<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><br><br>

<b>4.</b>The HTML Superscript element 'sup' specifies inline text which is to be displayed as superscript for solely typographical reasons. 
Superscripts are usually rendered with a raised baseline using smaller text.<br>
Example:maths formula X<sup>2</sup>+Y<sup>2</sup>+2XY=(X+Y)<sup>2</sup>
