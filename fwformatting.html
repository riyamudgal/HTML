Here, I am sharing some <b>HTML Quotations and Citations</b><br><br><br>

1. Formatting short quotations with q element:<br>
The HTML q element indicates that the enclosed text is a 
short inline quotation. Most modern browsers implement this by 
surrounding the text in quotation marks. This element is intended for short 
quotations that don't require paragraph breaks;
Example: <q>If your dreams don't scare you, then they are small.</q><br><br>

2.Formatting quoted statementr with blockquote element:<br>
The blockquote element defines "a section [within a document] that is quoted from another source". 
The blockquote element is used to indicate the quotation of a large section of text from another source.
Example: <blockquote>For nearly 60 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature. 
The world's leading conservation organization, WWF works in 100 countries and is supported by 
more than one million members in the United States and close to five million globally.The terms 
Internet and World Wide Web are often used without much distinction. However, the two terms do not
 mean the same thing. The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks. In contrast,
 the World Wide Web is a global collection of documents and other resources, linked by hyperlinks and URIs.
 Web resources are accessed using HTTP or HTTPS, which are application-level Internet protocols that use the 
Internet's transport protocols.</blockquote><br>

3.Formatting text direction with bdo element:<br>
BDO stands for Bi-Directional Override.

The bdo tag is used to override the current text direction.<br>
This element contains dir attributes which is used to specify the direction of text written 
inside the <bdo> element. The dir attribute contains two values which are listed below:<br>

rtl:The text direction from right to left (reverse the text).<br>
ltr:The text direction from left to right.
Example:<br>
<bdo dir="rtl">This line will be written from right to left</bdo>
